A WordPress plugin for managing custom post types and custom meta boxes from a theme.

== Description ==

With [PixTypes](https://github.com/pixelgrade/pixtypes) you can allow your theme to define what custom post types or meta-boxes should be active when your theme is up

Note: This plugin is addressed to developers, it doesn't do nothing if it isn't [properly configured](https://github.com/pixelgrade/pixtypes#pixytpes_config).


== Installation ==

1. First you will need to configure your theme to [define PixTypes settings](https://github.com/pixelgrade/pixtypes#pixytpes_config)
2. Install PixTypes either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. After activating PixTypes all your custom post-types should be visible now.
